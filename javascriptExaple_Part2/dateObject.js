// JavaScript Date Objects = objects that contain dates and times
// these date objects can be changed and formatted

//Creating Date Objects:
//Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor
// new Date(year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds,ms)

//const date = new Date(2024, 2, 13, 3, 4, 5, 1);
//console.log(date);

//new Date() creates a date object with the current date and time:
/*const d = new Date();
console.log(d);*/

//new Date() creates a date object with the current date and time:
//const d = new Date('february 13, 2024, 11:49');
//console.log(d);
